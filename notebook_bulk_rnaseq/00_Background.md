## Project Title  &emsp; [*2025_collaborator_organism_rnaseq*] &emsp; e.g., 2025_gif_arabidopsis_rnaseq 

[one stentence summary]
> This project explores the transcriptomic profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana atrx-1 mutant and wild-type plants using bulk RNA-seq.

The following hypotheses or research directions guide the analysis: *(define 1–3)*

> 1) Loss of ATRX function alters global gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana.  
> 2) The atrx-1 mutant exhibits transcriptional signatures indicative of disrupted chromatin regulation.  
> 3) ATRX deficiency reprograms key transcriptional networks involved in development and stress responses.

EXAMPLE  
The goal of this project is to characterize transcriptomic changes resulting from the loss of ATRX histone chaperone function in Arabidopsis thaliana. ATRX is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, and its disruption is expected to affect gene expression networks linked to development and stress response.

The experiment involves bulk RNA sequencing of whole seedlings from two genotypes:
- Wild-type (WT) plants (3 samples)
- atrx-1 loss-of-function mutants (3 samples)

By analyzing differential gene expression between these groups, we aim to identify:
- Genes and pathways affected by ATRX deficiency
- Chromatin-regulated transcriptional modules disrupted in the mutant
- Regulatory signatures potentially linked to developmental or stress phenotypes

The results will advance our understanding of ATRX function in plants and may reveal conserved roles in chromatin-mediated gene regulation.
